Upload sound files, share instant webplayer links and receive comments

## Motivation
After picosong.com went offline (rip) I needed a new alternative website to upload mp3 files to, without the need of registration and account bond uploads which many other services rely on. It did not take that long to realize that it isnt that much of a task to code myself. So here we are.

## Implemented Features
- mp3 upload including random id
- connectivity to mysql database
- uploader includes tboxes for interpret, title and other meta stuff
- hit counter
- (optional) comment box
- (optional) lyrics
